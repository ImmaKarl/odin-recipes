        <img src="../img/potato-salad.jpg">
        <p class="desc">This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on tables from the north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes", 
            you'll find Patate Prezzemolate everywhere in Italy: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in 
            school cafeterias. <em>Buon appetito!</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="ingredients">5 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li class="ingredients">4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li class="ingredients">2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
            <li class="ingredients">2 green onions (white part only), chopped</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1/2 cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li class="ingredients">salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps">Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, 
                but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li class="steps">While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. 
                Add garlic and set aside.</li>
            <li class="steps">Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl 
                and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to 
                break the potatoes.</li>
            <li class="steps">Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
        </ol>
