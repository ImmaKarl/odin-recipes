        <p class="desc">In the 1800's this is how people made lemonadeâ€”you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="ingredients">5 lemons </li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 and 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 and 1/4 quarts water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps">Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
            <li class="steps">Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, 
                so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
            <li class="steps">Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. 
                Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
            <li class="steps">Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, 
                pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
        </ol>
